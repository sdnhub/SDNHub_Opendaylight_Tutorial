# HOW TO BUILD

Before building, be sure to configure your environment correctly.  See the instructions at [GettingStarted:Development Environment Setup](https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/GettingStarted:Development_Environment_Setup).  In particular, you must customize your `~/.m2/settings.xml` file, since "OpenDaylight maintains its own repositories outside of Maven Central, which means maven cannot resolve OpenDaylight artifacts by default".

In order to build it's required to have JDK 1.8+ and Maven 3.2+. 
The following commands are used to build and run.
```
$ mvn clean install
$ cd distribution/opendaylight-karaf/target/assembly
$ ./bin/karaf
karaf>feature:install sdnhub-XYZ
```
